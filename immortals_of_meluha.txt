After marching continuously for four weeks, the caravan of invited immigrants crested the final mountain to reach the outskirts of Srinagar, the capital of the valley of Kashmir. Nandi had talked excitedly about the glories of his perfect land. Shiva had prepared himself to see some incredible sights, which he could not have imagined in his simple homeland. But nothing could have primed him for the sheer spectacle of what certainly as paradise. Meluha . The land of pure life! he mighty Jhelum river, a roaring tigress in the mountains, slowed down to the beat of  languorous cow as she entered the valley. She caressed the heavenly land of ashmir, meandering her way into the immense Dal Lake. 

Further down, she broke way from the lake, continuing her journey to the sea. he vast valley was covered by a lush green canvas of grass. On it was painted the asterpiece that was Kashmir. Rows upon rows of flowers arrayed all of God’s colours, their brilliance broken only by the soaring Chinar trees, offering a majestic, yet warm Kashmiri welcome. The melodious singing of the birds calmed the exhausted ears of Shiva’s tribe, accustomed only to the rude howling of icy mountain winds. ‘If this is the border province, how perfect must the rest of the country be?’ whispered
Shiva in awe.
